## Goals
Filament Hero strives to help those in the 3D Printing community to handle the stresses of managing filament usage, remembering print settings, and keeping track of parts for a project. Filament Hero will assist the user in keeping a record of their filaments, prints, and project parts in a easy to use application. 

When a user adds a Filament to the application, any prints that use said filament will update the remaining legnth and weight of the filament. The user may also keep track of what temperature the nozzle and bed are set at for optimal prints. Additional notes about the filament may also be added.

When a user creates a print record, settings about the print are tracked such as filament weight, layer height, and other critical metrics. A user may link to the URL that the STL was downloaded from, if applicable. Additional notes my be added to keep track of what went well, or wrong durring a print.

Printer profiles are added to keep track of what the current status of a printer is, printing, in maintance, ect. Printer profiles are also used to keep track of what the current or most recent print was done on the printer. Build volumes are recorded for easy reference.

Planing a project can be tricky if there are dozens of parts to print over a period of time. Creating a project will assist the user in keeping track of how many of each part is printed, printing, or in finishing. As a print status is updated, the parts list will also be updated to reflect the status change. 

A community section will help show off prints and projects. Links to the print settings will be provided to help others know when went well or what caused a failure.
